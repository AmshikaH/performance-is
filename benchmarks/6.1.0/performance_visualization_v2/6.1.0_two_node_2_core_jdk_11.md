Our test client is [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/index.html). We test each scenario for a fixed duration of
time and split the test results into warm-up and measurement parts and use the measurement part to compute the
performance metrics. For this particular instance, the duration of each test is **15 minutes** and the warm-up period is **5 minutes**.

We run the performance tests under different numbers of concurrent users and heap sizes to gain a better understanding on how the server reacts to different loads.

The main performance metrics:

1. **Response Time**: The end-to-end latency for a given operation of the WSO2 Identity Server. The complete distribution of response times was recorded.

The following are the test specifications.
